My name's Laura and this is my family. My father's name is David. He is forty-one years old and he works in a hospital. My mother's name's Sylvia. She's forty years old and she works as a schoolteacher. My parents met twelve years ago. They went on a cruise with some friends and they fell in love there. My dad always says it was love at first sight! They got married in 2000. My older brother, Kevin, was born in 2001. He's eleven years old now. Kevin isn't a good student. He always forgets his homework and he often gets detention. He thinks he's the best footballer in the world! I was born in 2003, so I'm nine. My grades aren't so bad, but I don't like maths. My favourite school subject is art and my dad says I've got a creative soul. I've got a younger brother. His name's Samuel. He's twelve months old and he's very cheerful.

My dad's parents are Joe and Miranda. Joe is my favourite granddad. He's nice, but he's totally deaf. Most of the time, he doesn't know what I'm saying. That's cool because we sometimes play tricks on him. We move our lips without making a sound and he says: “What? Speak up”. Grandma doesn't like that. Grandma's name is Miranda. She was a cook and she still bakes delicious cakes.

My mum's parents are Rose and Homer. They are seventy-one years old. My grandmother used to be a nurse, and my granddad was a professional photographer. He still takes amazing pictures. He likes nature and he often goes bird watching.
